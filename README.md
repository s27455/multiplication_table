# multiplication_table
Simple project created to train js functionalities and able to learn multiplication table beyond 100. This simple project allows to me practice js core functionalities, like switches, loops, simple DOM manipulations. I connected it with a database on localhost using PHP. And at the end but not least, i experimented with chart.js
