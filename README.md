# multiplication_table
Simple project created to train js functionalities and able to learn multiplication table beyond 100. This simple project allows to me practice js core functionalities, like switches, loops, simple DOM manipulations. I connected it with a database on localhost using PHP (I plan to replace it with node.js when I learn it). And at the end but not least, i experimented with chart.js. Ofcourse I know I might write code better, but it's one of my first real projects,  so Im think I do not have to worry so much right now, of course I'm planning to fix it in the future.
I want to point out that this project was focused on js, so i did not care about pretty css styles, and responsiveness. I only have carried about the basics
